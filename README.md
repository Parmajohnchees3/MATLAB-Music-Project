MATLAB program that plays a snippet of "Merry-Go-Round" from Howl's Moving Castle
This MATLAB file allows your computer to play a .wav file of a short excpert from Howl's Moving Castle. By using two different functions and a variety of different vectors, this program allows different sinusoidal waves to be overlapped and played in conjunction with each other, creating sounds to make a piece. 
If you would like to take a listen, copy this file and run!
